## Description
The ScoreSocial application was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. When using ScoreSocial, the user can preview games across five different leagues, view the odds of the games, and by using a point system, place bets to increase or decrease the total points.
